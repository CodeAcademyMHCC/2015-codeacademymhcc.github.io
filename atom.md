title: Using Atom in Class
permalink: /atom/

For some projects and exercises in class we'll be using [Atom](http://atom.io), an open-source text-editor created by [GitHub](http://github.com). This page contains instructions for how to setup our Atom environment for class.

Due to powers beyond our control, the computers we use in class won't retain any document or settings we save to them. That means we'll need to re-download our packages and setup our projects in Atom. This tutorial is designed to make that experience a little less tedious.

**To setup Atom for class:**

- Find Atom on the desktop and double-click it to open it.
- Hit Ctrl+, to bring upthe Settings tab. From this tab selection Install to bring up the Install Packages view.
- Search for mhcc-code-academy in the search bar. Simply typing "mhcc" should be enough.
- Install the package. This should take a moment or two.
- Open the Packages menu. You should see MHCC Code Academy as an option. Select this and choose "Install Packages" from the submenu
- Wait while the packages we'll be using in class are installed.
- That's it!
