For projects outside of [Treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) we'll be using a combination of [Atom](http://atom.io) and the [GitHub app](http://windows.github.com) to edit, save and publish our work. This is partly to demonstrate good practices and create familiarity with version control and git, and partially out of necessity due to the way the labs are setup and our inability to save work locally.

**To setup GitHub for class:**

- Find the GitHub app on the desktop and double-click it to open it.

**If you're loading a project from your flash drive:**

- Go to the + in the upper-left-hand corner to create a new project. Choose **Add** from the three available options (Add, Create, Clone)
- You should get a prompt to choose a folder. Find the folder on your flash drive containing the previously git-based project you were working on.
- It should now appear in the list of projects on the sidebar of the GitHub app. You should be able to push/pull and sync things as normal from here.

**If you're loading a new project from GitHub:**

- Go to the + in the upper-left-hand corner to create a new project. Choose Clone from the three available options (Add, Create, Clone)
- You should see a list of projects available to cloen from GitHub, both under your username and the [CodeAcademyMHCC organization](https://github.com/CodeAcademyMHCC). Choose the project you'll be working on.
- You should now be prompted for a place to store the cloned version of the project locally. Save the project to your flash drive.
- It should now appear in the list of projects on the sidebar of the GitHub app. You should be able to use normally from here.
