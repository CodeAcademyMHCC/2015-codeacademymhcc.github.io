Your tutorial project should consist of the following sections:

1. An introduction to the project. Who/what/where/why
2. A list of things someone will need for the project.
3. 3-5 steps that take the user through the process
4. A summary of how the project should appear when it’s finished.
5. Other projects the user might want to explore or ways he or she could extend the one in this example.

Start by forking this CodePen pen:

[http://codepen.io/mandis/pen/waZObG](http://codepen.io/mandis/pen/waZObG)

It will automatically load [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) into your pen.

Whatever your topic, I suggest you pick something accessible enough that it would be easy to find [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) licensed photos on [Flickr](http://flickr.com) to accompany your project.


## Layout ideas

So long as your tutorial project contains all of the aforementioned sections there is no steadfast rule for how they should be presented. You can find some general ideas sketched below:

We will go over these more thoroughly in clasee, but here are some ideas to consider:

- Alternating left/right, photo/text layouts for each step.
- Using full-width, background-images behind your text for the header and footer.
- Breaking your steps down into separate page and linking between them (Will require creating multiple CodePen pens).
- Requiring a "click to view" approach to each step.
- Using the a [carousel](http://getbootstrap.com/examples/carousel/) to display individual steps, or possibly steps within steps.


## Ideas for additional components

- Borrow the interactive checklist idea from [wikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page). Example at bottom of page: [http://www.wikihow.com/Bake-a-Cake](http://www.wikihow.com/Bake-a-Cake). 
- Add a "Share" button for FaceBook/Twitter/Pinterest.
- Include call-out “tips” or “notes” along the sides of your steps. Make them interactive so you can click to show/reveal/collapse.
- Include a sidebar that allows visitors to jump to a particular step. Make it follow the user down as the page as he or she scrolls? Only have it appear once they've scrolled past a certain point?
- Include a form to have people contact you with comments and suggestions.
